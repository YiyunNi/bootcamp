# Image Similarity Search

- In this [notebook](image_similarity_search.ipynb) we will be going over the code required to perform reverse image search. This example uses a ResNet model to extract image features that are then used with Milvus to build a system that can perform the searches. 

- Here is the [quick start](QUICK_START.md) for a deployable version of a reverse image search.

- Also can run this [notebook](milvus_with_different_models.ipynb) for image similarity search on different models(VGG16 and ResNet).
