Question answering system is a very classical problem in the field of natural language processing, which is used to answer questions asked by people in natural language form and has a wide range of applications. Its classical application scenarios include: intelligent voice interaction, online customer service, knowledge acquisition, emotion-based chat, etc. The common classifications are: generative and retrieval-based chatbot; single-round Q&A and multi-round Q&A systems; open domain-oriented and domain-specific Q&A systems. 

This project deals with mainly in domain-specific Q&A systems, which are usually called - intelligent chatbots.

## Try notebook

In this [notebook](TUTORIAL.ipynb) we will be going over the code required to perform a chatbot. This example uses a BERT to extract features od questions that are then used with Milvus to build a system that can perform the searches. 

## How to deploy

- Here is the [quick start](QUICK_START.md) for a deployable version of a question-answering system.
